## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
# Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The variables that pro are vehicle lenght and ground clearance.
# Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? 
The slop of the linear model is consider to be zero.
# Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? 
I think this model was effective in predicting mpg of the MechaCar prototypes.

## Study Design: MechCar vs Competiton
# What metric or metrics are you going to test?
The metrics being tested are MPG and suspension coils.
# What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
My null hypothesis is there no statistical difference in the average MPG and suspension coil.
# What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
I used an ANOVA test because I want to test how the avergaes of differ between each category. 
# What data is needed to run the statistical test?
The data needed to run this test are the averages of the MPG and suspension coils.
